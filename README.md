A simple sandbox for playing with Three.js

You can use the mouse for moving the camera around the scene with left button and zoom with the wheel button.

The engine use WebGL for rendering but if the browser don't support it, a fallback with a CanvasRenderer is used.

This sandbox can be use on modern browsers (even Intenet Explorer 9)
